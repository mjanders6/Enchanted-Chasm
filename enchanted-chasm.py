Pseudo Code
    Build the board
    Build  the interrior walls
    Load the walls into the board
    Create a list of locations on where the walls are
    Generate Random numbers for the following
        4 random inegers + numbers of walls
            Min of 3 walls
            Monster
            Pit
            Hero
            Treasure
        Check 
    Replace elements in the wall list with the elements from the random numbher
        correlating to the monster, hero, pit, treasure
    
List of Functions:
- Generate board
* Generate interior walls
- Build a list where there is a wall
* Place monster, pit, treasure on the board
* Generate random spawn locations
* Move the hero
